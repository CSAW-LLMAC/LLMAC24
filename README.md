# CSAW24_LLMAC_Submission Guideline

Please submit **all the transcriptions** you want to submit under each category; you can submit transcriptions that did not solve the challenge for points towards creativity and presentation. 
To create a submission create a release (described below) with the following naming convention:

`{category}_{challenge_name}_{solved / unsolved}.{extension}`

1) The trascript for submission should be named with the above convention and placed in the `TRANSCRIPT` folder
2) To more formally present your work please place a `write-up` for the transctip in the `WRITE-UP` folder. 

**Each release to be evaluated for points must contains a transcript/log, and a write-up**

The write-up structure and content is decided by each team. 

We suggest including a `write-up` for each challenge submission, explaining the way you solved the challenge, and your modifications/features made to the agent. 

We encourage creativity in agent customizations, and new-code feature enhancements. Your `write-up` is your opportunity to descibe the creative methods employed :) 

The `write-up` will contribute to your score for creativity (30 points) and presentation (20 points, 10 of which come from a provided demonstration). 


## WRITE-Up Suggestions

* One `write-up` submission per challenge
* A `write-up` explains how you attempted to solve a challenge with your agent of choice
* Detailed `write-ups` are encouraged and can boost presentation points  
* Document the various attempt methods and their corresponding results
* Your reasoning for why your agent changes were effective
* Relevant screenshots and/or code and log snippets are permitted
* Full transcripts not to be evaluated for grading can be submitted in `ANCILLIARY` folder, and referenced in write-ups
